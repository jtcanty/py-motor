# py-motor
This repository contains a simple library called 'py-motor' which can be using to simulate time-series data containing discrete 'jump-points'. In this particular application, we will be simulating the characteristics time-series signal observed by molecular motors walking on microtubules. These time-series measurements of displacement vs. time are usually acquired using fluorescence imaging with one-nanometer accuracy (FIONA) or using an optical trap.

## py-stepsimulator
This notebook contains examples where 'py-motor' is used for simulating step-wise time series data as typically observed in experiments with molecular motors.

### Dependencies

Install the Anaconda package manager before use.
Additionally, the mpld3 package is used in order to manipulate inline figures within the notebook. To install `mpld3`, navigate to the command-line and paste the following: 

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge mpld3 
```
After the package is finished installing, open the notebook and start playing around.

### Dependences

Install the Anacandona package manager before use.
